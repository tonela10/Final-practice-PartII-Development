# Healthcare Appointment and Records Management System

**This project provides a system for managing healthcare appointments and patient records.**

## Features

* **User Management:**

    * Patients can:
        * Book, cancel, and reschedule appointments.
        * View their medical records.
        * Update their profile information.
    * Doctors can:
        * Manage their appointment availability (set time slots).
        * View and manage their appointment schedules.
        * Create and update patient medical records.
    * Admins can:
        * Manage all users (create, edit, delete).
        * Oversee all medical records.
        * Configure appointment settings.

* **Appointments:**
    * Efficient appointment scheduling system.
    * Real-time appointment availability checks.
    * Automated notifications (simulated) for appointment confirmations, updates, and cancellations.

* **Medical Records:**
    * Secure storage and management of patient medical records.
    * Comprehensive record keeping, including diagnosis, prescriptions, notes, test results (e.g., blood tests, x-rays), and ongoing treatments.
    * Patient access to their own medical records (read-only).

* **Specialties and Departments:**
    * Categorization of doctors by medical specialties.
    * Organization of hospital departments and their services.
    * Patient ability to filter doctors by specialty.

* **Search and Filters:**
    * Patient-friendly search for doctors by specialty, availability, and location (if applicable).
    * Advanced search and filtering capabilities for administrators.

* **Access Control:**
    * Robust access control mechanisms to protect patient data privacy.
    * Patients can only access their own information.
    * Doctors can only access and manage data related to their patients.
    * Administrators have full system access.

* **Audit Log:**
    * Detailed audit trail of all user actions within the system.
    * Logs include user ID, action performed, timestamp, and affected resource.
